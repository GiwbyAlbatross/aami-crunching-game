This is *the* AAMI Curnching Game.

## Running
From the root of the repo, run `python3 ./run.py` or `python3 -O src/main.py` if you want to do it in optimised/production mode.
Hold C to crunch, use WASD to move. Z activates your hat's special ability and, in the second level, orders doorddack (smack it) which summons a doordacker and has a small chance of summoning snoop.

### installation/dependancies
If you have python installed (I think it needs 3.9 or later but idk) it is pretty easy to install its dependancies: `python3 -m pip install -r requirements.txt`.
If that fails, you may have to install pip (some python installations don't come with it) with `python3 -m ensurepip`. These instructions are for UNIX. Screw microsoft.

## Aim of the game
Crunch as many AAMIs as possible ('you won' sequence triggers at score=50) and avoid Tina Fey, for she will crunch you.

## Where the hell does all this weirdness come from?
Long story short, I bunch of television ads.
